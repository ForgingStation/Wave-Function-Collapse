# Wave Function Collapse
 A live project where I am trying to realize Wave Function Collapse for procedural content generation
 
 ****13/11/2021****
 Barely getting started with the basics of procedural content generation using wave function collapse. I am excited about this project and will keep adding small enhancements in-between other projects so stay tuned!
It took a while to even understand how unity deals with vertex positions and how it could be used. I am not sure if a generic WFC algorithm can be made but if one understands the algorithm, I think it can be used in a pipeline to procedurally generate content, at least some content for a game.
Took me a while this one. This is extremely inefficient but readable at this point. Share your feedback/suggestions  on optimization and ways to improve the approach I am taking here!
